# React Formation

Here are some React workouts. To follow the training use [this](https://github.com/KnockNow/react-formation/blob/master/React.js%20-%20introduction.pdf).

The points raised during the exercises :
  - Simple React Component
  - React Component nesting
  - Connected React Component with Redux
  - Create a basic project with the React ecosystem (webpack, babel, npm ... )
  - Setting up React-router


### Installation

This project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v6+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd react-formation
$ cd exo1
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```

In `exo1`, the exercise is split into several files. These files represent different stages of advancement in training.
To change the exercise, you must edit the `webpack.config.js` file.

Here are the possibilities :
```sh
4 : entry: './src/index.js'
OR
4 : entry: './src/index.1.js'
OR
4 : entry: './src/index.2.js'
OR
4 : entry: './src/index.3.js'
```

And after need to revive the server with :
```sh
npm run start
```
